/**
 * Created by gouthamvidyapradhan on 30/11/2019 A rectangle is represented as a list [x1, y1, x2,
 * y2], where (x1, y1) are the coordinates of its bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) are the
 * coordinates of its top-right corner.
 *
 * <p>Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. To be clear, two
 * rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.
 *
 * <p>Given two (axis-aligned) rectangles, return whether they overlap.
 *
 * <p>Example 1:
 *
 * <p>Input: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3] Output: true Example 2:
 *
 * <p>Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1] Output: false Notes:
 *
 * <p>Both rectangles rec1 and rec2 are lists of 4 integers. All coordinates in rectangles will be
 * between -10^9 and 10^9.
